It is a lite library, you can make your project depend it easily, and your project will be UNDEAD.

  * support to keep alive from Android_API 9 to Android_API 23
  * support to keep alive in most of devices(contains Samsung\Huawei\Meizu\Mi\Nexus..)
  * support to keep alive in FORCE_CLOSE from SystemSettings and MEMORY_CLEAN from third-part apps (such like CleanMaster\360 and so on)
  * support to keep BOOT_RECEIVER work well simplely

### Version
1.0

## Installation
#### STEP1
make your project depend on LibMarsdaemon, and regist 2 Service and 2 BroadcastReceiver in your manifests in 2 different process.

```sh
<service android:name=".Service1" android:process=":process1"/>
<receiver android:name=".Receiver1" android:process=":process1"/>
<service android:name=".Service2" android:process=":process2"/>
<receiver android:name=".Receiver2" android:process=":process2"/>
```

Service1 is the Service which you want to be undead, you can do somethings in it.

But the others is used by Marsdaemon, so DONNOT do anything inside.

#### STEP2
make your application extends DaemonApplication and override the method getDaemonConfigurations(). Return back the confugirations.
```sh
@Override
protected DaemonConfigurations getDaemonConfigurations() {
    DaemonConfigurations.DaemonConfiguration configuration1 = new DaemonConfigurations.DaemonConfiguration("com.marswin89.marsdaemon.demo:process1", Service1.class.getCanonicalName(), Receiver1.class.getCanonicalName());
    DaemonConfigurations.DaemonConfiguration configuration2 = new DaemonConfigurations.DaemonConfiguration("com.marswin89.marsdaemon.demo:process2", Service2.class.getCanonicalName(), Receiver2.class.getCanonicalName());
    DaemonConfigurations.DaemonListener listener = new MyDaemonListener();
    //return new DaemonConfigurations(configuration1, configuration2);//listener can be null
    return new DaemonConfigurations(configuration1, configuration2, listener);
}
```
if you want to override attachBaseContext you will find it had been defined final by me. you can override attachBaseContextByDaemon instead it.

see more details in MyApplication1 in Demo

##### if your application has extends another application, you should create a DaemonClient and perfrom it in attachBaseContext(), DONOT forget perform super.attachBaseContext() before!

```sh
private DaemonClient mDaemonClient;
@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
    super.attachBaseContext(base);
    mDaemonClient = new DaemonClient(createDaemonConfigurations());
    mDaemonClient.onAttachBaseContext(base);
}
```
see more details in MyApplication2 in DemoMarsdaemon 

#### STEP3
Launch the Service once, and try to kill it.
